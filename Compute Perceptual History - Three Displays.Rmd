## Utilities

```

## Constants
```{r constants}
mixed_state <- -2

```

## Import and Preprocessing
```{r Import data}
reports <- 
  read_csv("Data/3Displays.csv", 
         col_types = cols(Observer = col_character(),
                          Display = col_character(),
                          Block = col_integer(),
                          Time = col_double(),
                          State = col_integer(),
                          Duration = col_double())) %>%
  
  # renaming `Display` into `Group`
  rename(Group = Display) %>%
  
  # converting state code from 1:-1 to 1:2 (allows direct indexing)
  # -2 is still an unclear state
  mutate(iState = as.factor(State),
         iState = fct_relevel(iState, as.character(mixed_state), after=Inf),
         iState = as.integer(iState)) %>%
  
  # readjusting duration based on rounded time (1 ms won't make much difference)
  group_by(Observer, Group, Block) %>%
  mutate(Time = round(Time)/1000,
         Duration  = lead(Time) - Time) %>%
  
  # computing mean duration that will be used together with normalized tau
  group_by(Observer, Group) %>%
  mutate(IsClear = State != mixed_state, 
         Tmean = mean(Duration[IsClear], na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  
  # marking out durations eligible for the analysis
  mutate(IsValid = IsClear) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(iRow = 1:n())
```

## Computing history for the recent and distant past
```{r recent past}
reports_with_history <-
  reports %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Observer, Group, Block) %>%
  do(computeHistory(., taus, length(levels(.$iState)), mixed_value))
    
simplified_reports <-
  reports_with_history %>%
  group_by(Observer, Group, Block, Tau) %>%
  # slice(3:n()) %>%
  ungroup () %>%
  filter(State != mixed_state) %>%
  select(Observer, Group, State, Time, Duration, HistorySame, HistoryOther, Tau, iRow)


write_csv(simplified_reports, "Data with History/3Displays.csv")
